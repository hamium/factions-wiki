 **Season 4** Started 27th of February 2024, and is the current hamiumMC season.

 #### History (so far)

 As people got resources and gear, multiple factions were made (not in the order of creation): [Central Intelligence Agency](/factions/cia.md), [Internet Explorers](/factions/ie.md), [Aerial Empire](/factions/ae.md), the quickly disbanded Communist Ghosts and Banana Syndicate, the rebranded [Greenie Company](/factions/gc.md) and [Sky Crew](/factions/sc.md). By this point, many factions had villagers or some form of farms. Added to the factions were [Opera Institute of China](/factions/oic.md) and [Sovereign Lands of Noxus](/factions/slon.md).
 Slightly after this, the [End event](/events/ends4) happened, although nothing special occurred.
