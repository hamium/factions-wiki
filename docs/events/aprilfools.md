#### Events
##### Stockpiling Emeralds 
OHIO_STATE and [***iSark***](../players/isark.md) began stockpiling emeralds to collect all possible types of guns. At the end of April 1, ~16 stacks of emerald blocks were collected from the [***IE***](.../factions/ie.md) Raid Farm, and trading with villagers. The End Reset was delayed for 2 days.
This part of the article will be filled as more info is gathered.

##### Delay for Gun Orders 
The gun shop created was run by [***Ham_***](../staff/ham.md), and he had not automated the procedure. Hence, guns could be purchased only when he was online. However, he was rarely seen on the server. Only [***Minocp***](../players/minocp.md) of IE was able to purchase every single gun in the shop. Many active players were unhappy at this. Eventually, 
[***kaeud***](../staff/kaeud.md) was given the responsibility to sell guns, and players could pre-order their weapons.

##### Late Removal of Plugins
[***Social Distancing***](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/april-fools-social-distancing.76598/) was removed a few days after it was supposed to be removed. [***QualityArmory***](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quality-armory.47561/) was removed on April 12, yet it was supposed to stay forever. [***LeUnium***](../staff/unium.md) justified this by saying QA had been on the server beyond its duration. This misunderstanding angered more of the player-base, and preluded to a period of inactivity on the server.
