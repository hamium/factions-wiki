#### Events
##### The Start
[***Ham_***](../staff/ham.md) teleported (tpa) the players online to a custom structure with the End Portal, from where the members would enter the End. This was, however, not strictly enforced, so other Strongholds with End Portals could be used as per convenience as well. ManBoyThing of [***IE***](../factions/ie.md) was the first to enter the End Dimension. The other members soon jumped through the portal, after making final preparations and setting their spawn near the portal.

##### Server Lag 
Due to the influx of members on the same dimension, there was a lot of lag during the event. Some complained about their ping and FPS, the latter can be attributed to the Nullscape Plugin for advanced End terrain generation. The issue would persist with other members, like [***Hades***](../players/hades.md) who complained about chunks loading too slow.
