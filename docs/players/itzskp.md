##### :material-account-question: About
SKP was the creator of the `Salmon Faction` (SF) - the main competitor to world domination of `DRON` (Democratic Republic of Noxus), in Season 3. While DRON boasted the largest members, SKP's diligence and incomparable hours of game-time brought SF to the level of self-sufficiency and war. When war came, well, it lasted exactly 30 minutes (a massive meme for days to come), and SF faced a humiliating defeat. SKP however was adamant to never yield to LeUnium's faction, and even in Season 4, he upholds the rivalry. SKP created the `Aerial Empire`, refusing to join any ex-DRON member. He is, however, friendly in-game, generous to new players of his faction and of rivals as well. <br>
According to an insider, SKP named his faction "Salmon Faction" when he noticed he had a salmon in his inventory. <br>
SKP fkin hates iSark (who is writing this wiki page about him) because he may or may not have made fun of SF, himself being a part of DRON. Hence, SKP has scandalously denied multiple requests to join AE (Aerial Empire) in Season 4.<br>
SKP joined the server on `January 13, 2024`, and his first 2 messages were : "mhm / whats the ip?". Blind to the fact that "the ip" was LITERALLY on top of his message,he was met with an exasperated ham replying with "r e a d  ‚Å†üìö„Éªinfo  g o d d a m i t".<br>
Recently (March 7, 2024), he has been accused of using x-ray hacks, but all charges were dropped for lack of evidence.<br>
<br>
***Side Note:*** Just so the author of this wiki does not get mauled by him tonight, SF surrendered to DRON in 30 minutes of war because : 1. It was based on punching, and 2. SF had few members online (2-3) compared to DRON's 8-9 members.<br>
