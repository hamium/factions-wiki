He practically founded the <code>Dragon Slayers</code> base on a cliffside near <code>Lockheed Martin</code> (LM) base of DRON. The nation of DRON prospered with DS and LM as its capitals.  2. He became arguably one of the richest on the server in terms of valuables (diamonds, netherite, ancient debris, elytras etc.). 3. He has created multiple farms, like the Raid Farm, redesigned the trading hall at the <code>Notre Dame</code> (ND) base of DRON, and much more.  4. In Season 4, he created the IE faction, and it very soon became a replica of DRON (almost) paralleling his old faction in terms of riches and self-sufficiency.
